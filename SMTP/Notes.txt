Data Set -> 
1 - Indepantant variable (Compulsory) 
2 - Dependant Variable  -> on categaory of dependant variable we decide algorith 
                            if Dependant variable is catagorical type we Prefer classification algorithm

    if both values then it is label data (SuperWised)
    other wise it is unlabled (unsupervised )


* Hyper Parameter
        -> Which change taste of bhaji 


KNN (K Nearest Neighbours) -> Powerful Algorithm is Powerful when data set is less.
        It doesnt do anything in Training Phase .
        It Does Every thing in Predict Method.
